# JsAndDatabase

Hi,

In this repo, i am experimenting with creating a JS MVC application and getting familiar with the basics.

Currently I have planned a login page, which on login will render a different page without refresh.

Database connectivity and complete implementation will be later.

Direction of entire project in terms of functionality is a WIP.

Thanks!
